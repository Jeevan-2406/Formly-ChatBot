# Using Conditional Logic

Conditional logic allows you to show or hide specific fields based on user answers.

## Example Use Case

If a user selects "Other" in a dropdown, you can display a follow-up text box asking for more info.

## How to Add Logic

1. Select a field
2. Click on the **"Logic"** tab
3. Set a condition like:
   - *If [Question A] is [Yes], then show [Question B]*

## Tips

- Logic applies in real-time while the form is being filled
- You can chain multiple conditions together
- Keep logic simple for better usability
